# WeLearn

Repository for the WeLearn project.
The idea is for it to be a platform where everyone can share their self-made lectures/lessons and learn from the other ones available.
Primary focus is on students in primary/secondary school and respectively, their teachers. 

The application has the following functionalities and characteristics:
- Administrator user role, only select few are in it and can moderate a large part the contents, regardless if particular one is their creation or not.
- Posts -> creating, reading, updating, deleting
-- Every post has files (as zip), video material, category and appropriate grade attached to it that can be changed
- Comments -> creating, reading, updating, deleting
- Reports (comment reports and post reports) -> creating, reading, updating, deleting
