# WeLearn

Repository for the WeLearn project.
The idea is for it to be a platform where everyone can share their self-made lectures/lessons and learn from the other ones available.
Primary focus is on students in primary/secondary school and respectively, their teachers. 

## The application has the following functionalities and characteristics:
- Administrator user role, only select few are in it and can moderate a large part the contents, regardless if particular one is their creation or not.
- Posts -> creating, reading, updating, deleting
-- Every post has files (as zip), video material, category and appropriate grade attached to it that can be changed
- Comments -> creating, reading, updating, deleting
- Reports (comment reports and post reports) -> creating, reading, updating, deleting

dotnet WeLearn.Web.dll
```

## Notes
- You can run with ```ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production``` too, but you will need to configure Cloudinary for this one.
- CLOUDINARY_URL is the value we saved earlier.
- For security measures, Cloudinary will not allow us to download the zip files that are getting uploaded, unless the account is permitted to - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_delivery_options#blocked_delivery_formats_for_security/.

The app should be running on the address shown in the terminal's output.

For Ubuntu, you may need additional codecs for playing the video files.
